The second tips is to clear cache of the application by dooing th following in the application folder symfony cc

Advanced

There's a bit more configuration you want to do
Labels of phone numbers or emails does not match correctly to your data

Edit the file /apps/frontend/config/app.yml, take care to not add tabulations at start of each lines then modify or add the list of multivaluelabels section in the order you want
The exported csv file does not match to your needs

Edit the file /apps/frontend/modules/person/templates/listSuccess.csv.php and modify as you want (You need few skills in php language)
